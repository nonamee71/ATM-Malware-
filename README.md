Ploutus V2.1 !!!!!
Works only on NCR and Diebold Nixdorf.
Price 1 000 euro. The software works pretty simple :
Can be run on Windows and Android (8.0 or highter) devices. The NCR and Diebold Nixdorf ATM's use Windows XP OS and are connected to hidden wifi network. The software contains hidden wifi finder, brute force tool and wordlist. The procedure is absolutely wirelessly! All you need to do is to be less than 20 meters from the ATM, turn on the wifi finder, get the password via the bruteforcing tool and send the trojan to the ATM. The next step is to go in front of the ATM, press two buttons on the device that you got connected through and start collecting the money. I can provide video of the program and the ATM that spits the cash.
