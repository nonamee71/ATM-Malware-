# ATM-Malware-
Works only on NCR and Diebold Nixdorf. The software works pretty simple : Work on Windows and Android (8.0 or highter) devices. The NCR and Diebold Nixdorf ATM's work on Windows XP os and are connected to hidden wifi network. The software contains hidden wifi finder, brute force tool and wordlist. The procedure is absolutely wirelessly! All you need to do is to be less than 20 meters from the ATM, turn on the wifi finder, get the password via the bruteforcing tool and send the trojan to the ATM. The next step is to go in front of the ATM, press two buttons on the device you got connected through and start collecting the money.
